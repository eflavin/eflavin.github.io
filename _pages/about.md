Eunhye Flavin is a Senior Research Scientist at Georgia Institute of Technology in Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computer (CEISMC). Eunhye leads STEM education research projects and outreach activities, focusing on K-12 mathematics in and out of school settings as well as mathematics teacher education. She received her Ph.D. degree from the Lynch School of Education at Boston College in 2021, specializing in Mathematics and Technology Education. She was awarded as an Early Career BIPOC faculty mentee from the Association of Mathematics Teacher Education (AMTE) in 2023, and she currently serves as a Research Committee member at AMTE. Eunhye was also given the Professor of the Month Award in 2022 as an Assitant Professor (tenure-track) at Stonehill College. In 2023 and 2024, she was selected as a Senior Class Gift mentor honoree and as a mentor nominee for the Tri-Alpha inaugural induction ceremony. She has taught courses in the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Education Studies. Her research vision is to develop technology and learning environments that leverage intelligent systems (e.g., augmented reality, artificial intelligence) to enhance learning experiences of mathematics for historically marginalized populations.
